# Freshworks

Main file contains the CRD functions
Client file contains the access files to the functions in Main file

Main file should be excuted first and then comes the Client file
User can also create his/her own Client file with any name and can access the main file if he/she wrote the code in python

Here the client file is created just to show the implementation of Multi-threading and normal access to the file
